# PasswordGenerator
Using python


This is a Python project that uses the secrets and string modules to generate a strong and secure password, much like you can with popular password managers.

The string module obtains all possible letters, digits, and special characters, while the secrets module allows us to obtain cryptographically secure passwords.

The code for this project is relatively simple as it uses a loop to continually generate passwords until it contains at least one special character and two digits. You can, of course, modify this to fit your own super-strong password rules!
